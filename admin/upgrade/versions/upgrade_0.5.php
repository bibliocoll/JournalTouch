'Version 0.5
New: xxxMajorFeaturexxx
xxx


New
- Introduced xxx
- Added option xxx


Changes
- Moved admin/upgrade/history to data/upgraded because folder needs writing permission (Version 0.4 missed this requirement in the installation instructions)


Improvements
- No more errors if new versions of JournalTouch provide new settings. They now always get loaded from default settings.


Fixes
- xxx


Known Issues
- The cover update does not work if you use the JournalTocs Premium update. JournalTocs now provides covers via api. Since I got no premium account, I can\'t modify admin/services/getLatestJournalTocPremium.php accordingly.
- Sometimes the log is not outputted to the Journal Update page (likely because browser times out); you can manually check data/journals/LastUpdateLog.html or open it from the admin menu


Added 3rd party ressources
- xxx: URL
