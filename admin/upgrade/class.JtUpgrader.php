/**
 * Manage Upgrade of JournalTouch (well, the class might be used for anything else ;))
 *
 * Basically upgrades should work similar to e.g. Wordpress. A user just downloads
 * the newest version, extracts it and overwrites old files. Subsequently an
 * upgrader does the remaining house keeping tasks.
 *
 * How it works
 * 1.   If an upgrade was completed successfully, the version number is written in
 *      admin/upgrade/history (as filename).
 * 2.   For each version an upgrade file with specific actions reflecting the
 *      necessary changes since the last version can exist (must not).
 *      Location: admin\upgrade\version ; Format "upgrade_%versionnumber%.php"
 *
 * This way upgrades can be done from any version to the newest one. (Even though
 * it seems unlikely that JT will have a lot of these - but this is the reason
 * I'm not looking for a full-blown existing solution).
 *
 * @note:   This probably is flexible enough to handle more possible upgrade
 *          changes. Currently there is no method for deleting files, but it
 *          would be easy to add without breaking anything. Same goes for e.g.
 *          database upgrade.
