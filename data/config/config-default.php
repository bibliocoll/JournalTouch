 *        make strings translatable. In regards to arrays, especially with
 *        named keys, objects are easier to read in code (remember all those
 *        'Bla '.$ary['important'].' and so on' ;)
 *        Btw.: nice way to convert multi dimension arrays:
 *          $obj = json_decode(json_encode($array));
 *
 * @todo  Maybe create a class JournalTouch with static properties?

 * premium service seems to offer cover links via api (which in turn points to the
 * publishers sites) - info as of 2015-10-30.
 *
 * As of version 0.4.0 JournalTouch provides a way to download covers. This
 * divided into two sections: 1) Generic sources and 2) Publisher's websites.
 * By default everything is deactivated. Set 1 in src_genric and src_publisher
 * for whatever service you want to query for covers. Be aware that you should
 * know perfectly well if you are legible to do so (e.g. by some kind of fair
 * use law or special agreements with the specified service/publisher).
 * Using STMcovers is most likely safe since the domain is registered to Elesevier
 * and it offers cover downloads explicitly, yet again - it's your responsibility.
 *
 * As for the logic:
 * 1. If a cover in data/covers exists none will ever be downloaded (e.g. useful if
 *    covers never change anyway). This one will always be displayed.
 * 2. If a cover exists in data/covers/api it will be displayed
 * 3. If no cover exists in either folder, it will be downloaded using the
 *    activated services.
 * 3.1 above publisher is preferred to a generic source (you might want to
 *     disable Elsevier since STMcovers provides real high quality ;))
 * 3.2 If no publisher is provided (auto via updater) generic sources are checked
 * 4. If a cover exists in data/covers/api, but a new issue is found by the
 *    updater, it will be redownloaded.
 *
 * Note: If yout set anything for api no images from the folder will be loaded
