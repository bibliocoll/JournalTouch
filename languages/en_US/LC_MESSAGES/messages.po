"                    <p>There are rumours that cover api's for journals exist, but no free service is known. So, it's up to you how you get the covers (ask vendor, journal publisher...). While not to be found on JournalTocs official website, the premium service seems to offer cover links via api (which in turn points to the publishers sites) - info as of 2015-10-30.</p>\n"
"                    <p>As of version 0.4.0 JournalTouch provides a way to download covers. This divided into two sections: 1) Generic sources and 2) Publisher's websites. By default everything is deactivated. You can enable whatever service you want to query for covers on this setting page. Be aware that you should know perfectly well if you are legible to do so (e.g. by some kind of fair use law or special agreements with the specified service/publisher). Using STMcovers is most likely safe since the domain is registered to Elesevier and it offers cover downloads explicitly, <strong>yet again - it's your responsibility!</strong>\n"
"                    <p>As for the logic:\n"
"                    <ul>\n"
"                    <li>1. If a cover in data/covers exists none will ever be downloaded (e.g. useful if covers never change anyway). This one will always be displayed.</li>\n"
"                    <li>2. If a cover exists in data/covers/api it will be displayed</li>\n"
"                    <li>3. If no cover exists in either folder, it will be downloaded using the activated services.</li>\n"
"                    <li><ul>\n"
"                    <li>3.1 Enabled publisher sources are preferred to generic sources (you might want to disable Elsevier since STMcovers provides real high quality ;))</li>\n"
"                    <li>3.2 If no publisher is provided (which automatically is the case if found at JournalTocs) generic sources are checked</li>\n"
"                    </ul></li>\n"
"                    <li>4. If a cover exists in data/covers/api, but a new issue is found by the updater, it will be redownloaded.</li>\n"
"                    </p>\n"
"                    <p>Note: If yout set anything for api no images from the folder will be loaded</p>\n"
