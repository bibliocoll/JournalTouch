By default everything is deactivated. You can enable whatever service you want to query for covers on this setting page. Be aware that you should know perfectly well if you are legible to do so (e.g. by some kind of fair use law or special agreements with the specified service/publisher). Using STMcovers is most likely safe since the domain is registered to Elesevier and it offers cover downloads explicitly, <strong>yet again - it's your responsibility!</strong>\n"

"                    <li>1. If a cover in data/covers exists none will ever be downloaded (e.g. useful if covers never change anyway). This one will always be displayed.</li>\n"
"                    <li>2. If a cover exists in data/covers/api it will be displayed</li>\n"
"                    <li>3. If no cover exists in either folder, it will be downloaded using the activated services.</li>\n"

"                    <li>3.2 If no publisher is provided (which automatically is the case if found at JournalTocs) generic sources are checked</li>\n"
"                    </ul></li>\n"
"                    <li>4. If a cover exists in data/covers/api, but a new issue is found by the updater, it will be redownloaded.</li>\n"
"                    </p>\n"
