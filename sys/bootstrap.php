 * Bootstrap everything needed for running JournalTouch. Always include it!

 * A central place to do everything needed after including the config file and
 * before a distinct php page is loaded. Do stuff a user should not see in the
 * config, but that is necessary before processing any script

 * @todo (Ideas)
 * - Maybe use autoload
 *
 * @todo (Improve)
 * -  Include position in config-default.php sucks, but it has to be after the
 *    the language definitions and before the first use of gettext. Maybe the
 *    very best option would be to create a real config page in admin/
 * - Add this to a function? Make it better readable
