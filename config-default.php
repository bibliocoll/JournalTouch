 *        using arrays resp. an ini file. In regards to an ini file you can
 *        make strings translatable. In regards to arrays, especially with
 *        named keys, objects are easier to read in code (remember all those
 *        'Bla '.$ary['important'].' and so on' ;)
 *        Btw.: nice way to convert multi dimension arrays:
 *          $obj = json_decode(json_encode($array));
 *
 * @todo  Maybe create a class JournalTouch with static properties?
